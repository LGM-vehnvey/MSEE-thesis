    \chapter*{Abstract}
    The evolution of CMOS technology and the analog limitations that come with it move the direction of stable clock generation and frequency synthesis 
    towards all-digital phase-locked loops (ADPLL). At the heart of this type of systems is the time-to-digital converter (TDC), which directly replace the
    phase-frequency detector (PD) in analog PLLs. This revolution towards ADPLLs has sparked abundant innovation in the field of TDC design, yet there has
    been little focus in bipolar delay line TDCs.
    
    This thesis presents the analysis, design, and implementation of a 5-bit bipolar TDC that doubles the intrinsic dynamic range of standard architectures,
    alongside its corresponding digitally-controlled oscillator (DCO) based on a cross-coupled pair LC-tank.

    \chapter*{Acknowledgements}
    First and foremost, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor, Dr. Guillermo Espinosa Flores-Verdad, for his invaluable guidance, unwavering support,
    and immense patience throughout this research. His expertise and insightful feedback were fundamental to the completion of this work.

    I am also grateful to M.S. Erick Arenas for his advice on the DCO design.
    \chapter*{Dedications}
    To my wife and parents, for their unconditional support and love.
