ABSTRACT = {In this paper, two of the most common calibration methods of synchronous TDCs, which are the bin-by-bin calibration and the average-bin-width calibration, are first presented and compared. Then, an innovative new robust calibration method for asynchronous TDCs is proposed and evaluated. Simulation results showed that: (i) For a synchronous TDC, the bin-by-bin calibration, applied to a histogram, does not improve the TDC’s differential non-linearity (DNL); nevertheless, it improves its Integral Non-Linearity (INL), whereas the average-bin-width calibration significantly improves both the DNL and the INL. (ii) For an asynchronous TDC, the DNL can be improved up to 10 times by applying the bin–by-bin calibration, whereas the proposed method is almost independent of the non-linearity of the TDC and can improve the DNL up to 100 times. The simulation results were confirmed by experiments carried out using real TDCs implemented on a Cyclone V SoC-FPGA. For an asynchronous TDC, the proposed calibration method is 10 times better than the bin-by-bin method in terms of the DNL improvement.},

abstract = {A bipolar low-power pipeline time-to-digital converter (TDC) for digital phase-locked loop (DPLL) applications is implemented with six 1-bit cascaded stages. The stages consist of a compensated ×2 time amplifier (TA) using the time-to-current conversion technique, two modified SR-latch-based time comparators, and a static logic called offset-64, which aligns the output bit of the stage to create a 7-bit output code without the zero-gain issue. The presented mathematical analyses reveal the low sensitivity of the proposed TDC to the offset of the TA. The layout of the proposed TDC was designed in a 65 nm CMOS technology. Post-layout simulation results demonstrate a 1.7 ps time resolution and power consumption of 450 μW for a sampling frequency of 125 MS/s.}
