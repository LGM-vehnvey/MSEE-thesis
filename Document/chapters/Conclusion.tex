\chapter{Conclusions}
This thesis presented the analysis, design and implementation of a 5-bit bipolar TDC with double the dynamic range of such architectures and its correspondent DCO implemented with
a cross-coupled pair LC tank oscillator. It also provided a detailed analysis of the design considerations of both CP-PLLs and ADPLLs.

The broader significance of this research extends beyond a single TDC implementation, offering an architectural blueprint for this critical and increasingly on demand circuit in
modern technology nodes.
The key contributions of this work are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The development of a new technique to double the dynamic range of bipolar TDCs by modifying both decoders and adding a frequency retrieving digital circuit.
    \item The replacement of a VCDL for a DLL inside the forward-path of the TDC to improve its robustness against PVT variations.
    \item The establishment of a comprehensive design methodology for TDCs and DCOs in advanced CMOS technology nodes.
\end{itemize}
