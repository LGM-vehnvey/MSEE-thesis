\section{TDC}
The TDC was simulated in Cadence Virtuoso using the Spectre simulator. The test bench (TB) is that of figure \ref{fig:TB_TDC_Schematic}, where the reference input signal is connected
to a square wave voltage source with a frequency of 100 MHz and a 50\% duty cycle, the other input (feedback) is connected to a similar source but with a frequency of either 100.1 MHz
or 99.9 MHz depending on whether a positive or negative phase difference is to be measured. Both of these cases simulate conditions that would occur in a PLL when the DCO frequency is
slightly higher or lower than the reference frequency, respectively. The outputs of the TDC are connected to a load capacitance of 10 fF to simulate the effect of the subsequent DLF.
